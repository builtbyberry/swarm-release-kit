# this stays completely silent, so it never nags unrelated projects.

# The CLI resolves everything itself: the store URL and project from the repo's
# release-config.json (falling back to the hosted store), and the token from
# `marshall login` or MARSHALL_TOKEN. This hook passes nothing in.
#
# It used to export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_SRM_URL / _TOKEN, but 0.8.1 removed the
# manifest's `userConfig` block when the MCP url was hardcoded, so those variables
# have been unset ever since — the exports were reading a mechanism that no longer
# exists and always resolved to empty.

# who you are, get told about a release-config.json you have never seen) — so the
# hook now asks for it explicitly. Without this flag, a signed-in user would be
# greeted in every repo on the machine.
#
# Non-zero here means any of: this repo doesn't use Marshall, not signed in, or
# the store is unreachable. All of them mean the same thing to us: say nothing.
