# Release Init (SRM)

Bootstrap a release the SRM-native way: **create the project and release
directly in the shared store** through its write-path tools, with zero GitHub
round-trip. The operator names a theme and a version-or-slug and walks away with
a live release in SRM.

This is the SRM-native counterpart to the GitHub-seeded `/release-init`. That
one scaffolds a repo's `.claude/release-config.json` and expects the release to
enter SRM later via a GitHub milestone + `php artisan srm:import-release`. This
one is **born-in-the-store**: it calls `project_create` / `release_create`
directly, so the release exists in SRM the moment you finish — no milestone, no
import. SRM *augments* external trackers, it doesn't replace them, so an external
link (GitHub/Jira/Linear) is **offered but optional** — the store is the source
of truth.

It is **create-only and additive**: it never edits or deletes, and re-running
against a release that already exists **resumes** rather than duplicating.

## How it talks to the store

- `mcp__srm__project_create` — resolve-or-create the workspace project. The
  external-tracker link — `repo` (owner/name) plus `tracker_kind` (github /
  jira / linear) — lives **here** and is **optional**; a project does not
  require a GitHub repo. If a project already matches in the current workspace
  it is reused, not duplicated.
- `mcp__srm__release_get` — probe whether the release already exists under the
  project, so a re-run **resumes** instead of creating a second one.
- `mcp__srm__release_create` — create the release under the project from
  `theme`, `version` (a version-or-slug like `v0.5.0`), and `out_of_scope`.
  `slug` is derived from `version` when omitted. `source` is recorded as
  `native` (vs `imported` for the GitHub-import path).

Both creates are workspace-scoped and fail-closed — no cross-workspace create,
no existence leak — matching the rest of the write path.

**If the write-path tools aren't available** (an older store, pre plan-write-path),
`project_create` / `release_create` won't be exposed by the connected MCP server.
**Stop and point at the import seam** rather than improvising: create a GitHub
milestone + issues and run `php artisan srm:import-release <repo> <milestone>` on
the server (or use the GitHub-seeded `/release-init` + import flow). Do not try to
fabricate the project/release any other way — the store is the only place they can
be born.

## Procedure

1. **Gather the release inputs** (ask; don't guess):
   - **Project** — the workspace project name (and optionally the external
     tracker link `repo` + `tracker_kind`, which stays optional).
   - **Theme** — a one-line theme for the release (becomes the CHANGELOG intro
     and PR subtitle downstream). Accept `_TBD_` and remind the operator to fill
     it in at wrap.
   - **Version-or-slug** — e.g. `v0.5.0` or `payments-revamp`.
   - **Out of scope** — what this release explicitly will *not* cover (optional).
2. **Preflight: confirm the write path exists.** If the connected SRM MCP server
   does not expose `project_create` / `release_create`, stop and surface the
   import fallback above (`php artisan srm:import-release`). This is a graceful
   refusal, not an error to work around.
3. **Resolve-or-create the project — and offer the optional external-tracker
   link here.**
   `mcp__srm__project_create { name: "<project>", repo?: "<owner/repo>",
   tracker_kind?: "github | jira | linear" }`.
   - The external-tracker link lives on the **project**: `repo` (owner/name)
     plus `tracker_kind` (github / jira / linear). Ask whether to link one;
     make clear it is **skippable** and that the store is the source of truth —
     it's a stored link only, no GitHub/Jira/Linear API call, no bidirectional
     sync. If the operator skips, omit `repo` / `tracker_kind`.
   - It returns the project whether it already existed in the workspace or was
     just created. Report which happened ("reused existing project" vs "created
     project") so the operator knows nothing was duplicated.
4. **Probe for an existing release (idempotency / resume).**
   `mcp__srm__release_get { project: <project>, release: "<version-or-slug>" }`.
   - **Found** → the release already exists. **Do not create a second one.**
     Report it as already live and hand off (its components/graph are the next
     step). This skill stays create-only, so it won't change the project's
     external link on a resume — surface its current value as-is; to change it
     later, use the store's `project_update` tool.
   - **Not found** → continue to create it.
5. **Create the release.**
   `mcp__srm__release_create { project: <project>, version:
   "<version-or-slug>", slug?: "<slug>", theme: "<theme>", out_of_scope:
   "<out_of_scope>" }`.
   `slug` is derived from `version` when omitted; `source` defaults to
   `native`. On success, report the created release.
6. **Report.** Print the project (reused or created), the release version-or-slug
   and theme, whether an external link was attached, and the next step:
   `Run /srm:release-plan to add components, then /srm:release-graph to verify the
   dependency graph, and /srm:release-open to cut the branch.`

## Guardrails

- **Create-only (this skill).** This skill births a project + release; it does
  not modify or remove them — a re-run resumes an existing release, never
  overwriting or duplicating it. Editing a created record later is a separate
  path: the store's `project_update` / `release_update` tools (deletes remain
  unsupported).
- **Probe before you create.** Always `release_get` first. If the release exists,
  resuming is the correct outcome; creating a duplicate is a bug.
- **The store is the source of truth; the external link is optional.** Never
  require a GitHub repo or tracker ref to create a project or release, and never
  treat the external link as a fetch/sync — it's a stored reference only.
- **Fail closed on missing tools.** If `project_create` / `release_create` aren't
  exposed, do not improvise a project/release some other way — point at
  `php artisan srm:import-release` and stop.
- **This skill does not plan or branch.** Adding components is `/srm:release-plan`;
  verifying the graph is `/srm:release-graph`; cutting the release branch is
  `/srm:release-open`. Init only bootstraps the project + release.
- Surface any store error verbatim (a workspace/auth problem, a validation
  failure). Don't paper over it.
