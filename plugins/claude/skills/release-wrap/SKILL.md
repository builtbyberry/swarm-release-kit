# Release Wrap (SRM)

Drive the wrap of a release **against the shared SRM store**, in order: confirm
every component is merged → change-review each component → fill the CHANGELOG →
readiness review → honor the high-finding gate → hand off **ready-for-deploy**.
The store is the same across machines, people, and agents, so the wrap one person
runs is visible to everyone working the release.

This is the SRM-store port of the file-based `release-wrap`: same wrap ordering,
but **the store is the state**. Review progress is read from the release's
findings (`mcp__srm__record_finding` / `mcp__srm__resolve_finding`), not a local
`review-state.json` / `release-state.json`. This skill *composes* the review
skills — it does not duplicate their lens logic.

This port is **deploy-mode only** (`wrap.mode == "deploy"`). The final state is
**ready-for-deploy**, handed to `/srm:release-deploy` — there is no tag step and
no UPGRADING.md (those belong to the tag-mode file-based wrap).

## How it talks to the store

- `mcp__srm__release_get` — read the release: every component with its
  server-derived work-state (`open | in_progress | proposed | merged`), the
  **existing findings** (`kind: change` and `kind: readiness`), and the deploy
  progression. This is the state — there is no local wrap file to read. When all
  components are `merged`, the release sits in the **`wrapping`** derived phase;
  that is the precondition for this skill.
- `mcp__srm__release_status` — the live coordination picture: which components are
  still held, and which have **drifted** (a hold that went quiet and silently
  reopened). Use it to catch a component that looks done but isn't truly merged.
- `mcp__srm__record_finding` / `mcp__srm__resolve_finding` — these are driven by
  the composed review skills, not called directly here. The wrap **reads** the
  findings they produce to drive the gate.
- `mcp__srm__set_component_state` — only the composed `/srm:release-topic` flow
  moves components to `merged`. This skill does not advance work-state; it reads it.

(If the MCP server isn't connected, stop and say so — there is no local fallback
for the wrap state, the findings, *or* the lenses.)

## Config

`.claude/release-config.json` is still read for non-lens fields only:

- `wrap.mode` — **must be `deploy`**. If it is `tag` (or absent), this SRM wrap
  refuses and points at the file-based tag-mode `release-wrap`. Lens *selection*
  lives in the store (`project.reviews.*.lenses`), not here.
- `wrap.changelog_path` — the CHANGELOG to fill.
- `default_branch` — the diff base the composed reviews use.

Note `wrap.include_upgrading_md` and `tag.*` are **not** consulted: deploy mode
writes no UPGRADING block and cuts no tag.

## The store is the state (no local file)

Unlike the file-based wrap, this one keeps **no** `review-state.json`,
`release-state.json`, or `deploy-state.json`. Which phase the wrap is in is
derived every time from the store:

- **components** — `release_get`, all `merged`? (else: components still in flight).
- **change findings** — any `kind: change` finding still `open`? (phase 2 incomplete).
- **CHANGELOG** — does `<wrap.changelog_path>` still hold the placeholder for this
  release? (phase 3 not done).
- **readiness findings** — any `kind: readiness` finding still `open`? (phase 4 incomplete).
- **high gate** — any `high`-severity finding (either kind) `open` *or* `deferred`?
  (not ready-for-deploy).

The skill is fully resumable: invoked mid-wrap (a new chat, a later day), re-read
the store and continue from the first unsatisfied precondition. Never trust prior
conversation memory of "where we were" — re-read the store.

## Procedure

Announce which step the skill is entering and why; the user can interrupt at any
step boundary.

### Step 0 — Confirm the release is wrappable

1. Resolve the release version (ask if ambiguous — don't guess).
2. `mcp__srm__release_get { release }`. Confirm **every component's state is
   `merged`**. If any is `open | in_progress | proposed`, **stop**: list the
   unfinished components and tell the user to land them first (via
   `/srm:release-topic` → merge → `set_component_state merged`).
3. `mcp__srm__release_status { release }` to catch **drift** — a hold that went
   quiet and reopened a component that looks done. A drifted component is not
   truly merged; resolve it before wrapping.
4. Confirm `wrap.mode == "deploy"`. If not, refuse and point at the tag-mode wrap.

### Step 1 — Change review, per component

For each component in the release, compose **`/srm:change-review`** against that
component's diff. It records `kind: change` findings (scoped with `component_id`)
in the store via `record_finding`, reconciling against what's already there.

- Run them one component at a time (or dispatch in parallel if the user wants),
  and let each review record its own findings — this skill does not record.
- After the pass, `release_get` and walk the user through every `open`
  `kind: change` finding. For each, drive a resolution **through the review
  skill's modes** (which call `resolve_finding`): **fix** (make the change, then
  mark fixed), **defer** (with rationale), or **accept** (no fix planned).
- A `high` change finding left `open` or `deferred` will block Step 4's gate —
  surface that now so the user resolves it deliberately, not at the gate.

### Step 2 — CHANGELOG wrap

Mechanics mirror the file-based wrap, minus tag-mode extras:

1. Open `<wrap.changelog_path>`. Replace `## <release> - unreleased` (or the
   `_To be filled in during release wrap-up._` placeholder) with
   `## <release> - <today's date YYYY-MM-DD>`.
2. Fill `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` / `### Removed` by walking the
   merged components. Use `release_get` for the component titles/refs and the
   merged PRs for the prose; issue-numbered bullets, named feature in **bold**,
   behavior + rationale in plain prose.
3. **No UPGRADING.md and no tag** — `wrap.mode == "deploy"`. Deploy notes live in
   the release PR body / in-app changelog, not an UPGRADING block.
4. Commit `docs(changelog): fill in <release> release wrap-up`.

### Step 3 — Readiness review

Compose **`/srm:release-readiness`**. It runs the readiness lenses against the
release and records `kind: readiness` findings via `record_finding`, reconciling
against the store.

- After it returns, `release_get` and walk every `open` `kind: readiness` finding
  with the user, driving each to **fix / defer / accept** through the readiness
  skill's modes (which call `resolve_finding`).
- If readiness surfaces anything larger than a small fix, **stop** and tell the
  user — it likely needs to go back through change-review on a component, not a
  patch at wrap time.

### Step 4 — Honor the deploy-readiness gate

Re-read the store (`release_get`). The release is **not ready-for-deploy** while
**any `high`-severity finding — `kind: change` or `kind: readiness` — is `open`
or `deferred`.** This mirrors the server-side gate that blocks the actual deploy:
a deferred high is still an unmitigated high.

- If any high is `open`/`deferred`: list them (id, ref, kind, summary, status) and
  **refuse to proceed**. Each must be resolved to a terminal status — `fixed`
  (addressed) or `accepted` (explicit, owned risk acceptance) — via the composing
  skill's mode (`resolve_finding`). Re-check after each resolution.
- `medium`/`low` findings do **not** block; surface any still open/deferred so the
  user ships with eyes open.

### Step 5 — Mark ready-for-deploy

There is **no explicit store "ready" flag.** Ready-for-deploy is a *derived
precondition*, the conjunction of:

1. every component `merged` (Step 0),
2. CHANGELOG entry filled for this release (Step 2),
3. no `high` finding `open` or `deferred` (Step 4 gate clear).

When all three hold, declare the release **ready-for-deploy** and hand off to
**`/srm:release-deploy`** — surface the command and a one-line summary (merge the
release PR into `<default_branch>`, watch deploy, smoke-check, monitor). State
explicitly that the deploy skill **re-checks these same preconditions** against
the store before it merges, so nothing is taken on trust across the handoff.

Do not merge or deploy automatically. The user invokes `/srm:release-deploy` when
ready.

## Guardrails

- **Deploy mode only.** If `wrap.mode != "deploy"`, refuse and point at the
  file-based tag-mode `release-wrap`. Never tag and never write UPGRADING.md here.
- **The store is the source of truth** — derive every phase from `release_get`,
  not from conversation memory. Do not create a local wrap/review/readiness/deploy
  state file.
- **Compose, don't duplicate.** This skill records no findings itself; change
  findings are `/srm:change-review`'s job (`kind: change`), readiness findings are
  `/srm:release-readiness`'s (`kind: readiness`). It only *reads* findings to drive
  the gate and resolutions.
- **The high gate is hard.** An `open` *or* `deferred` high blocks ready-for-deploy
  — a deferred high is still unmitigated. Only `fixed` / `accepted` clear it.
  Refuse to declare ready-for-deploy while any high is unresolved; never work
  around the gate.
- **All components merged is a precondition, not a goal to force.** If a component
  isn't `merged` (or has drifted per `release_status`), stop and send the user back
  to land it — don't wrap a half-merged release.
- **Ready-for-deploy is derived, not stored.** Never invent a store flag for it;
  state it as the precondition `/srm:release-deploy` re-checks.
- The store enforces the finding lifecycle. Resolutions go through the composing
  skills' modes; surface `invalid_finding_transition` verbatim rather than working
  around it.
